#Scope and purpose
Main use case addressed: offering data exposition on a non relational data model (n - n relationship between entities)
 ,providing the capability to join relevant data and render them in a json like nested structure.

#Overview
The project aims to be an accelerator for building REST Api by configuration and offering an open toolbox for custom implementation.
Main components:
- Configuration file
- Controller with
    - RequestParam processor
- Service with
    - Fetch processor
    - Transform processor
    - Nest processor
- Repository
-


Its purpose is to fetch data in a repository instance and produce datasets, apply transformation to these datasets
and eventually apply join equivalent
Therefore 3 autonomous layers are found
- Fetch, returns a result set of each entities declared in configuration file
- Transform
- Nest
